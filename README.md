## Disaster Tweet Classification using TensorFlow ðŸš¨

This project aims to classify tweets as either **disaster-related** or **non-disaster** using various machine learning and deep learning models in TensorFlow. By processing text data and exploring multiple architectures, we compare model performance to find the best approach for accurate tweet classification.

### Project Overview
- **Objective**: Predict whether a tweet is related to a disaster event based on its text content.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Data Preprocessing**: Download and visualize the tweet dataset.
  2. **Text Vectorization**:
     - **Tokenization**: Convert words into numbers using tokenization techniques.
     - **Embedding**: Map tokens to dense embeddings, capturing semantic meaning.
  3. **Baseline Model**:
     - **TF-IDF**: Start with a classic TF-IDF model to set a baseline.
  4. **Deep Learning Models**:
     - Train and evaluate multiple models, including Dense, LSTM, GRU, Conv1D, and Transfer Learning architectures.
  5. **Model Comparison**:
     - Evaluate each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
     - Identify and analyze the most misclassified tweets to understand model limitations.
  6. **Model Ensemble**: Combine the best-performing models into an ensemble to improve overall predictions.
  7. **Model Saving and Deployment**: Save the trained model for easy loading and future predictions.

### Conclusion
The project explores several deep learning architectures to find the most effective approach for disaster tweet classification, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
