To predict whether the tweet is disaster or not a disaster using TenserFlow and comparing different models

```
Text -> turn into numbers -> build a model -> train the model to find patterns -> use patterns (make predictions)
```

* Downloading a text dataset
* Visualizing text data
* Converting text into numbers using tokenization
* Turning our tokenized text into an embedding
* Modelling a text dataset
  * Starting with a baseline (TF-IDF)
  * Building several deep learning text models
    * Dense, LSTM, GRU, Conv1D, Transfer learning
* Comparing the performance of each our models
* Combining our models into an ensemble
* Saving and loading a trained model
* Find the most wrong predictions
